# Life Countdown ⏳🫀🫁

**Time ≠ Life.**  
You don’t own time — you have a finite number of **heartbeats** and **breaths**.  
This tiny app visualizes your remaining beats/breaths/hours to nudge meaningful action.

### Live
- Web: https://mindfulaboutlife.codapt.app

### Why
Feather Flip — a daily “flip the narrative” spell. When I felt lousy, I shipped this.
Make every moment count.

### How it works
- Heartbeats ≈ `HR(bpm) × 60 × 24 × 365.25 × remainingYears`
- Breaths   ≈ `BR(bpm) × 60 × 24 × 365.25 × remainingYears`
Defaults: HR=70 bpm, BR=15 bpm, life expectancy=80y (configurable soon).
